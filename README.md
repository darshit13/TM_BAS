# TM_BAS
Threat Modeling for Building Automation Systems, continuation of the implementation of the concept.

Able to extract information : Site, Buildings, Floors and Spaces from the IFC file, and thus have defined classes accordingly. 
Have created a little menu as discussed for showing the IFC information of the components, Assignment of the Security features and also to show the already assigned properties. 

The assignment with the inheritance is working properly. 


Next edit will be to extract a report kind of a thing from the file in the form of a CSV format, and also to include the rules and assumptions implementation.
